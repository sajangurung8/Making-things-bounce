# Making-things-bounce
A webpage to make things bounce on 3D canvas giving user controls. Controls are not limited to buttons on the Webpage, you can move the 3D space by clicking on canvas and dragging whichever way you want.

The intention of this project is to explore animation using WebGL library and object manipulation in JavaScript. I am using WebGL library to make the animations possible. Three.js and OrbitControls.js are JavaScript library to manipulate Camera object in canvas and to things animate on canvas.
